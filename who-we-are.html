    <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>We are a London-based Community Interest Company (CIC) and social enterprise with a radical mission: to build health equity by placing community knowledge, voices, and leadership at the centre of how health is defined, researched, and delivered.</p>
      <p> We envision a world where epistemic justice is restored—where frontline communities lead the way in healing, health knowledge, and care practices.</p>
      <p>To achieve this, we practice epistemic disobedience—challenging systems that silence, erase, and marginalise us, while reclaiming our rightful place as leaders, knowledge-holders, and healers.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="info-panel info-who">
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
     <p>Striving towards epistemic justice, our mission is to centre the voices, values and healing traditions of frontline communities to advance health equity.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="info-panel">
    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
     <p>A world where epistemic justice is restored such that frontline communities can use our own knowledge systems and practices to lead global health action and maintain community health and wellbeing.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="info-panel info-who">
    <h2>Our Values</h2>
    <p>Our work plans are shaped by the shifting needs and priorities of frontline communities and are grounded in our core values – ensuring we always work in ways that are of, by and for the community:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Of the community:</strong>  We are a community of people whose lived experiences and knowledge, deeply aligned with principles of equity and justice, affirm a commitment in process and outcome to lessening the gap in health equities of frontline communities.  </li>
      <li><strong>By the community:</strong> We ground our work in participatory processes at every level. From shaping strategy to delivering services, our work is co-created with the frontline communities we belong to.</li>
      <li><strong>For the community:</strong> We put the interests of those most impacted by health injustice first -centring the voices, values and healing traditions of frontline communities and driving real change where it’s most urgently needed.</li>
      </ul>
