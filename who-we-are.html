  <h1>Who We Are</h1>
  <p>We are a London-based Community Interest Company (CIC) and social enterprise with a radical mission: to build health equity by placing community knowledge, voices, and leadership at the centre of how health is defined, researched, and delivered.</p>
  <p> We envision a world where epistemic justice is restored—where frontline communities lead the way in healing, health knowledge, and care practices.</p>
  <p>To achieve this, we practice epistemic disobedience—challenging systems that silence, erase, and marginalise us, while reclaiming our rightful place as leaders, knowledge-holders, and healers.</p>
  
  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>Striving towards epistemic justice, our mission is to centre the voices, values and healing traditions of frontline communities to advance health equity.</p>
  
  <h2>Our Vision</h2>
  <p>A world where epistemic justice is restored such that frontline communities can use our own knowledge systems and practices to lead global health action and maintain community health and wellbeing.</p>

  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>Frontline communities experience the most immediate and severe health impacts of structural violence, environmental degradation, infectious disease, poverty, and inequitable healthcare systems. Our knowledge and healing approaches are excluded from mainstream health practice — this is <strong>epistemicide</strong> and it results in healthcare systems that are not responsive to the needs of all populations, that reinforce existing power imbalances and health inequities, and perpetuate dependencies on dominant knowledge and resources. This can manifest as the dismissal of traditional healing practices, the disregard for community-based knowledge about disease patterns, or the prioritisation of biomedical models over social determinants of health.</p>

  <h2>Call to Action</h2>
  <p><strong>Epistemic Disobedience!</strong> To address epistemicide, it's crucial to recognise and centre the validity, value and role of frontline communities’ diverse knowledge systems, lived experiences and practices in global health action. Global health action includes activities such as research, health programming, outbreak investigation and response, advocacy and disease surveillance.
Frontline communities are not only at the forefront of health crises but also lead the way in epistemic resistance—confronting dominant paradigms and safeguarding knowledge systems that honour our communities’ inherent capacity to heal and sustain wellbeing. While some progress has been made in disrupting these prevailing structures, much more work remains.
.</p>

   <h2>Our Values</h2>
     <p>Our work plans are shaped by the shifting needs and priorities of frontline communities and are grounded in our core values – ensuring we always work in ways that are of, by and for the community:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Of the community:</strong>  We are a community of people whose lived experiences and knowledge, deeply aligned with principles of equity and justice, affirm a commitment in process and outcome to lessening the gap in health equities of frontline communities.  </li>
      <li><strong>By the community:</strong> We ground our work in participatory processes at every level. From shaping strategy to delivering services, our work is co-created with the frontline communities we belong to.</li>
      <li><strong>For the community:</strong> We put the interests of those most impacted by health injustice first -centring the voices, values and healing traditions of frontline communities and driving real change where it’s most urgently needed.</li>
      </ul>
