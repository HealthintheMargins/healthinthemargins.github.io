        Health in the Margins is a grassroots community organisation working to
        reimagine health, care, and healing by centring subjugated knowledge,
        lived experience, and community wisdom.

      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>
        We create spaces for reflection, dialogue, and action that challenge
        dominant approaches to health. Our work centres those most affected by
        health inequities and supports communities to reclaim and define their
        own health practices.

      <h2>About Us</h2>

      <h3>Julianna</h3>
      <p>
        Julianna is the founder of Health in the Margins and works at the
        intersection of research, lived experience, and epistemic justice.
        Trained as a medical anthropologist and epidemiologist, her work
        examines how dominant approaches to health shape whose knowledge is
        valued and whose is excluded.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through Health in the Margins, Julianna is committed to creating spaces
        where subjugated health knowledge is re-centred and communities most
        affected by health inequities are supported to lead their own practices
        of care and healing.
      </p>

      <h3>Katheryn Lotsos</h3>
      <p>
        Katheryn Lotsos is a psychotherapist whose work sits at the intersection
        of mental health and social justice. For over 25 years, she has worked
        alongside marginalised communities globally to co-create healing spaces
        grounded in lived experience and collective care.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a Director at Health in the Margins, Katheryn brings a strong
        commitment to trauma-informed, decolonial, and anti-oppressive
        approaches, and believes health justice requires confronting power
        within systems of care.
